# Favour Local Library
This project is an improved version of [Mozilla Developer Network Django Local Library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django).
This web application is an online catalog for a small local library where users can browse available books and manage their accounts. Users are not allowed to create account themselves. Library users are required to show interest by visiting the librarian and indicating their interest. The sole purpose of the local library web app is to allow persons know what books are available in the library and for library users to track the books they have borrowed and their return dates.
